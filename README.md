# coins-dynamic-programming-algorithms-class

Task for the AZA class at University. Knapsak problem of coins implemented as dynamic programming task in C.

## Task
I have list of coins with different value and weight. I also have a total amount of coins with same value. Task was to optimally group coins so the total value of the grouped coins is the specific value and total weight is minimal.

## Implementation 
Iplmentation was done on C language using dynamic programming from lecture notes.
